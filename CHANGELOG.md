## [0.0.1] - Unreleased

This is the first public release and it's under heavy development, so please
be aware that things will change frequently.

Some features are going to be removed as soon as we're able to, such as the
Unity Relay integration. This is because it's unsuitable for our architecture,
but it enables people to start using TNT immediately.
